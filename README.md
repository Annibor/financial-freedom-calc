## Testing

- Throughout the whole development of the webpage, I've made tests in:


### Manual testing

I tested the website manualy throughout the whole developing progress. The website is tested in Safari, Google Chrome and Brave. The website is also tested from an Iphone.

## Deployment

I deployed early to be able to test the website deployed during the development. Following step are a description of how to deploy a webpage on GitHub:

1. Open the []() and find the Settings tab.
2. The navigate to the tab called Pages on the left.
3. Choose to Deploy from a branch. For me it was the main branch.
4. Save it. It can take a few minutes, but then you will be able to find the link to the deployed website in the repository on the menu to the right, under []().
5. There you'll find the daployes website no top of the page under the heading Active deployments.

My link is: []()
